<p class="FrogApp">Working with land conservation biologist Bill Scullion, of the New Jersey Conservation Foundation, I have designed and developed a frog and toad calling web-app.  This app was created to aid Herpetologists working in the field. 
<p>Before this app identifying frog and toad species was a complicated process.  The scientists had few options, and often lost contact with the amphibians before they were able to conclusively identify them.  
<p>I consider this app my baby, although the code is a bit messy, it&#39s my first app that solved a real world problem.  User feedback and testing was a huge part of this project.  After weeks of testing, and hours on the phone, we finally went live with this project, and our user base has been growing every week.  <p>Working on this project with non-tech biologists taught me the skills needed to effectively communicate and collaborate with non-technical team members.

<h3>Ez-Keyboard</h3>
<p class="ezKeys">The Ez-Keyboard was designed to allow anyone with a passion for music the ability to join a jam session.
<p>Anyone who plays music is often confronted with the creative friend that wants to join in on a jam session, but lacks the technical skill.  The Ez-Keyboard was created specifically for that situation.  
<p>With this app anyone can join a jam session, all&#39s you need to do is let the user know what key you will be playing in and the Ez-keyboard will eliminate all the sour notes.
<p>This app was driven by testing and re-testing, It also taught me much about the caveats of HTML5 audio and key driven event triggers.
