<h3>On site digital solutions</h3>	
<p class="onSight">Professionally I have been developing Responsive mobile first landing pages for on site digital solutions since May of 2015.   This experience has further honed my skills in building fast responsive web pages without relying on bootstrap or other robust library&#39s.</p>

<h3>NjFrogSounds.com</h3>
<p class="FrogApp">Working with land conservation biologist Bill Scullion, of the New Jersey Conservation Foundation, I have designed and developed a frog and toad calling web-app.  This app was created to aid Herpetologists working in the field. 
<p>Before this app identifying frog and toad species was a complicated process.  The scientists had few options, and often lost contact with the amphibians before they were able to conclusively identify them.  
<p>I consider this app my baby, although the code is a bit messy, it&#39s my first app that solved a real world problem.  User feedback and testing was a huge part of this project.  After weeks of testing, and hours on the phone, we finally went live with this project, and our user base has been growing every week.  <p>Working on this project with non-tech biologists taught me the skills needed to effectively communicate and collaborate with non-technical team members.

<h3>Ez-Keys</h3>
<p class="ezKeys">In 300 years form now when historians are writing about the great information and technological revolution, they will be writing about the bay area.  I chose to move to San Francisco because I wanted to be surround myself with the brightest minds and talent of this era.  Not to mention the abundance of musical talent, and world-class surfing.</p>
